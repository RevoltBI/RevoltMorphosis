# Memory Bank and Rule Creation

Before marking any task as complete, you must perform the following two steps:

1.  **Update Memory Bank**: Review and update all relevant files in the `.roo/rules/memory-bank/` directory to reflect the changes made during the task. This is crucial for maintaining context and ensuring continuity.
2.  **Create Key Takeaway Rules**: If any new patterns, best practices, or important lessons were learned during the task, create new rules in the appropriate subdirectory to capture this knowledge. These subdirectories can be general, like `.roo/rules/`, or mode-specific, following the pattern `.roo/rules-[mode_slug]/` (e.g., `.roo/rules-code/`, `.roo/rules-architect/`). This helps prevent repeating mistakes and solidifies new skills.
