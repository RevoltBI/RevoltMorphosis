Updating memory bank (and the [README.md](../../README.md) file if appropriate) at the end should be part of every plan you make. Also always include a step to run relevant tests (e.g., integration tests, unit tests) to verify that the changes have been implemented correctly and have not introduced any regressions. This is a critical step to ensure the quality and stability of the project.
